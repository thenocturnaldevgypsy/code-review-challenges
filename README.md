## ![SECTION About this Repository](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/-About%20this%20Repository-2471AE?logo=repo&logoColor=white&labelColor=2471AE)

In order to provide a steady stream of tech and coding challenges that can help review sharpen my skills in programming, I signed up to some coding challenges portals and created this repo to save my progress/activities.
