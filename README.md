## ![SECTION About this Repository](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/-About%20this%20Repository-2471AE?logo=repo&logoColor=white&labelColor=2471AE)

In order to provide a steady stream of coding challenges that can help sharpen my skills in programming, I signed up to some coding challenges portals and created this repo to save my progress/activities.

## ![SECTION Contents and Breakdown](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/-Contents%20and%20Breakdown-2471AE?logo=book&logoColor=white&labelColor=2471AE)
At the moment, I'm taking the following programming challenges tracks:
| Portal | PL | Directory in this Repo (if any) | Track |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Exercism.org | PHP | `Exercism - PHP` | 12 of 114 |
| Exercism.org | Python | `Exercism - Python` | 3 of 140 |
| Exercism.org | Go | `Exercism - Go` | 1 of 141 |
| Exercism.org | Ruby | `Exercism - Ruby` | 1 of 120 |
| codecademy.com | Code Foundations | codecademy - Code Foundations` | Courses Done: 4<br>Lessons Only: 1 |

> [!NOTE]
> When I'm about to start with a challenge, I will always create an issue ticket with the programming challenge link info to keep track of my progress here at GitHub.
